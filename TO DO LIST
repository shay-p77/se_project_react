TO FIX

1. figure out why they are saying the radio buttons all get checked.

2. Please, delete the whole hardcode for adding items from universal ModalWithForm component, which can be used for any modal with a form in the future (not only for adding items).

3. The text near the inputs should be in a labeltag, to correctly bind the label text and input, according to the semantics

4. The whole code between the formtag and the submitbutton should be passed as childrenfrom outside the universal ModalWithForm component, which can be used for any modal with a form in the future (not only for adding items). children- it's an attribute that is automatically created in componentany It contains the entire markup which is located between the component's tags. So you can just put your entire layout inside the tags:

So, here will be only this:


        <form className="modal__form" onSubmit={handleSubmit} noValidate>
          {children}  // here will be everything 
          <button
            type="submit"
 
5. fix in header, use "weatherData" instead of the geolocation thing

6.  <h2 className="form__modal-title">New Garment</h2>
New Garmentis hardcoded in   universal ModalWithForm component, which can be used for any modal with a form in the future (not only for adding items). Please, pass title into the props. Please, pass buttonTextinto the props.
